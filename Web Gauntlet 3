## Challenge

Last time, I promise! Only 25 characters this time. Log in as admin 
Site: http://mercury.picoctf.net:24143/ 
Filter: http://mercury.picoctf.net:24143/filter.php



## Solution

We could do what we did on the other sites. Since the site filters out the word admin. We could put into the username box: ad'||'min.
What this || does is that it concatenates two strings so it combines 'ad' and 'min' to make admin and it would bypass the admin word filter.
Next we need to find a way to also make the password field return true as we see that when we type in sql injection this is what the computer reads

SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='something' AND password='something'

So if we look at all the sql operators that isn't filtered. I see the thing 'IS NOT'. This could work in getting the password to return true
So we could type in the password box: g' IS NOT 'o   
This password field would return true. Thus getting both conditions met and granting us a login
Username: ad'||'min
Password: g' IS NOT 'o
